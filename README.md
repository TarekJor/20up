20up
========

20up is a program for the backup of Tuenti, a Spanish social network. This program downloads all of the photos, comments, private messages and friends' information of a specific user.

If you have any problems, questions or improvements, please visit the Contact section of [20up web page](http://bmenendez.github.io/20up)

Thanks to [@outime](https://github.com/outime) and his [tpb](https://github.com/outime/tpb) repository I could update 20up to make it work again.
